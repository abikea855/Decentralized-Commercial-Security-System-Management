# Decentralized Commercial Security System Management

This repository contains a blockchain-based platform for managing commercial security systems in a decentralized manner. The solution provides transparent, immutable records of security infrastructure, maintenance activities, and incident reporting across protected properties.

## Core Components

The platform is built around four essential smart contracts:

1. **Facility Registration Contract**: Securely records and manages protected property details and security requirements
2. **Equipment Inventory Contract**: Maintains a comprehensive registry of security devices including cameras, alarms, and access control systems
3. **Maintenance Scheduling Contract**: Automates scheduling and verification of regular system testing and servicing
4. **Incident Reporting Contract**: Provides tamper-proof documentation of security breaches, false alarms, and system failures

## Key Features

- Immutable record of security infrastructure across multiple facilities
- Real-time equipment status monitoring and alerting
- Automated maintenance scheduling based on manufacturer specifications
- Transparent service history for compliance and insurance purposes
- Secure, timestamped incident documentation with evidence preservation
- Role-based access control for sensitive security information
- Integration capabilities with existing physical security systems
- Automated compliance reporting for regulatory requirements

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- Truffle or Hardhat development framework
- Web3.js or ethers.js library
- MetaMask or similar Ethereum wallet
- Ganache (for local development)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/decentralized-security-management.git
cd decentralized-security-management
```

2. Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

3. Compile smart contracts
```
npx truffle compile
```

4. Deploy to your preferred network
```
npx truffle migrate --network [network-name]
```

## Usage

The platform supports a comprehensive security management workflow:

1. Register facilities with detailed security requirements and floor plans
2. Add security equipment with complete specifications and locations
3. Set up maintenance schedules with automatic notification system
4. Document and track security incidents with supporting evidence
5. Generate audit trails for compliance and insurance purposes

## Benefits

- Reduced security system downtime through proactive maintenance
- Enhanced accountability for security service providers
- Improved regulatory compliance with automatic documentation
- Tamper-proof incident records for insurance claims
- Real-time visibility into security system status across multiple locations
- Streamlined handover between security personnel shifts
